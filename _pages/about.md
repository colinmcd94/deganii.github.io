I'm currently a master's student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. I'm working on a revolutionary holographic imaging technology to address a significant clinical need in lymphoma diagnosis across resource-limited settings. 

This low-cost system was developed at the Massachusetts General Hospital’s Center for Systems Biology, where I'm a research assistant. It provides a fast, on-site count of malignant lymphoma cells and can stratify high and low-grade lymphomas. It is scheduled for a prospective clinical trial in Botswana in 2018.  If successful, the clinical trial will yield a point-of-care platform that has the potential to improve significantly clinical outcomes for lymphoma patients across rural sub-Saharan Africa. 

Prior to MIT, I was a co-founder of [SnapJet](http://www.snapjet.com), an ultra-high resolution portable printer for smartphones. At SnapJet, I led a team that designed, patented, and raised over $210,000 in crowd-funding on Kickstarter. I've also also served as a technology vendor to Cornell University and the US Centers for Disease Control, delivering analysis tools that have played a key role in behavioral studies of HIV victims in 25 US cities. I have a BS in Computer Science from Cornell University’s Engineering School,
