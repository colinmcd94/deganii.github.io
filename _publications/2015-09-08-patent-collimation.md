This publication covers the core collimation technology behind [SnapJet](http://snapjet.com). An optical collimation array absorbs non-orthogonal light emanating from a smartphone display, thereby eliminating the need for traditional lenses to focus this light. This yields high resolution photos with very short printing timeframes.
